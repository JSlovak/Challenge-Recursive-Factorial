# Challenge-Recursive-Factorial

We are going to implement an algorithm to find the factorial of a given number. A factorial is defined as follows:

The product of all positive numbers less than or equal to a given number

Ex. factorial(4) //4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24

###The Catch

To solve this challenge you must take the following steps:

Create a new GitHub repo using good naming convention. (Don't think too hard, just use a descriptive name)
Install mocha/chai and write your tests BEFORE you write your function. Your tests should be running but failing before you write your function.
Write your function so that your tests pass. You MUST implement your solution using a recursive function.
